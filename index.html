        <p>The <span style="color : goldenrod">star</span> of <span style="color : darkred">David</span> don't belong to <span style="color : #B7410E">David</span> at all <br>
        He borrowed it from <span style="color : skyblue">Peter</span> just so he could pay off <span style="color : firebrick">Paul</span><br>
        <span style="color : skyblue">Peter</span> copyrighted the <span style="color : goldenrod">star</span> and now he owns the claim<br>

        Are you talking all this shit just to get on the cover?<br>
        Well then, how're you gonna eat when you're bitin' the hand?<br>
        Well, you know they don't like it when you take a stand<br>
        So enjoy it while you can<br>
        And say hi to all the boys in the band<br>
